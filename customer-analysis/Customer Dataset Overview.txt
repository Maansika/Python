This dataset provides insights into customer segmentation and purchasing behaviour. It includes the following key fields:
* LYLTY_CARD_NBR: A unique identifier for each customer loyalty card.
* LIFESTAGE: The stage of life the customer belongs to (e.g., Young Singles, Mid-Life Families, Retirees).
* PREMIUM_CUSTOMER: Indicates the customer's spending category, such as Budget, Mainstream, or Premium.

I analysed this dataset using Pandas and Matplotlib to extract meaningful insights.Here are some key analyses you can perform:

Customer Distribution by Lifestage: 
* Understand the distribution of customers across different life stages.
* Identify the largest and smallest customer segments.

Premium vs. Budget Customers:
* Analyse the proportion of Premium, Mainstream, and Budget customers.
* Identify if a particular lifestage group dominates a spending category.

Conclusion:
By analysing this dataset, I gain valuable insights into customer distribution, spending behaviour, and high-value segments.
These insights can be used for personalized marketing, customer retention strategies, and revenue optimization.
